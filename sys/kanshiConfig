# config for https://wayland.emersion.fr/kanshi
# to toggle video output of rumba jukebox
# when a second screen gets (dis-)connected
# copy to /home/pi/.config/kanshi/config
#
# please beware: kanshi or equivalents on X (autorandr)
# are not designed to detect if a screen is turned on or not
# -> they detect if a cable/docking station is pysically connected!
# unfortunately on linux it is currently not possible
# to reliably detect if a screen is powered on or not
